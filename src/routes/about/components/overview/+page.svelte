    An opportunity exists for two reasons:
    Tourism is a growing industry (4% annually), and within the industry adventure travel is growing at 10%.
    
    There are few providers of hard-adventure travel to upscale clients. Waterburg 
    Safaris will price its services at the middle of the market. We will provide an affordable service with prestige 
    value. Our prices will be within of reach for the majority of adventure travellers. Service will be priced based 
    upon luxury competitor prices and the value added of our offering. Providers that offer luxury services similar 
    to ours do so at similar prices. We are competitively priced in the luxury market. Because we appeal to a smaller 
    market, volume will be limited. However, we will be able to capture a higher gross profit margin.</p>
